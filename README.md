## General info
This simple painting was great as a initial project with Turtle library.
The main target was to get familiar with this GUI library.

The program generates dots, of a definable size, on the canvas. The colours of the dots are drawn at random from the original image using the colorgram module.

## Screenshots

## Setup

## Status
Project is: _finished_.

## Inspiration
